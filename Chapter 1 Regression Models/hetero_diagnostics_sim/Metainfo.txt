Name of Quantlet: Heteroskedasticity_Simulation_OLS_Diagnostics

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script generates synthetic data with heteroskedastic errors by pairing larger disturbances with larger regressor values, fits an OLS regression of y on x, and then produces three diagnostic plots using ggplot2: the data with fitted regression line, a histogram of residuals, and a residuals-versus-fitted-values plot. The three panels are arranged in a single row using the patchwork package, and the resulting figure is saved as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("heter_sim.png").

Keywords: Econometrics, Heteroskedasticity, Linear Regression, OLS, Regression Diagnostics, Simulation, R, ggplot2, patchwork
