Name of Quantlet: Engel_FoodIncome_OLS

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script loads the Engel data set (household income and food expenditure), fits a simple OLS regression of food expenditure on household income, and displays the regression summary. It then uses ggplot2 to produce a scatter plot of food expenditure versus income with the fitted regression line overlaid, and saves the resulting figure as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("foodincome.png").

Keywords: Econometrics, Engel Curve, Linear Regression, OLS, Data Visualization, R, ggplot2, Food Expenditure, Income
