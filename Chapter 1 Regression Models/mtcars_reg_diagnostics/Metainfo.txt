Name of Quantlet: MTCARS_Regression_Diagnostics

Published in: Econometrics_with_R

Description: This R script uses the built-in 'mtcars' dataset to fit a multiple linear regression model with 'miles per gallon' (mpg) as the dependent variable and several predictors (weight, horsepower, displacement, rear axle ratio, quarter-mile time, number of cylinders, and transmission type). It then computes multicollinearity diagnostics (VIF/GVIF and the condition number of the scaled design matrix), performs heteroskedasticity tests (Breusch–Pagan, non-constant variance score test, and a White-like variant based on fitted values and their squares), reports HC3 robust standard errors via 'coeftest', runs a Ramsey RESET functional-form test, produces standard residual and influence plots (including Cook's distances), and prints the correlation matrix of the numeric variables.

Keywords: Econometrics, Multiple Regression, Regression Diagnostics, Multicollinearity, Heteroskedasticity, Robust Standard Errors, Ramsey RESET, Cook's Distance, Correlation Matrix, R, mtcars
