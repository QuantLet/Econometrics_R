Name of Quantlet: BaxterKing_Filter_US_GDP_Cycle

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script demonstrates how to analyze U.S. real GDP per capita using the Baxter and King 
band-pass filter. It retrieves GDP data from the World Bank via the WDI package, applies the 
filter to extract cyclical components (representing business cycle fluctuations), and 
visualizes both the original series and the filtered output. The resulting plots are saved 
as a high-resolution PNG image.

Keywords: 
GDP, Business Cycle, Baxter-King Filter, Time Series, US Economy, WDI, Band-Pass Filter, R
