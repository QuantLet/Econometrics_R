Description: 
This R script defines a custom function to compute the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) 
of a univariate time series. It includes an example using synthetic data to demonstrate how the EWMA 
smooths out short-term fluctuations in a sequence by applying exponential decay to past observations.
