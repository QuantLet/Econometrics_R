Name of Quantlet: GDP_Transformations_WDI_US

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script downloads U.S. real GDP per capita data from the World Bank using the WDI package, 
and demonstrates three common transformations used in time series analysis: the original level series, 
first differences, and logarithmic differences. These transformations help assess trends, 
stationarity, and growth rates. The script visualizes all three series using ggplot2 and arranges 
them in a vertically stacked layout. The final plot is saved as a PNG file.
