Name of Quantlet: Nadaraya_Watson_MTCARS

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script applies Nadaraya–Watson kernel regression to explore the nonlinear relationship between horsepower and fuel efficiency in the built-in mtcars dataset. It extracts horsepower (hp) as the regressor and miles per gallon (mpg) as the response, selects an optimal bandwidth using KernSmooth::dpill(), and then estimates the regression function with locpoly() using a normal kernel, degree = 0 (Nadaraya–Watson), and a grid of 100 points. The fitted values are interpolated onto a fine grid over the range of horsepower and combined into a data frame for plotting. Using ggplot2, the script produces a scatter plot of the original (hp, mpg) observations with the estimated Nadaraya–Watson regression curve overlaid in blue. The resulting figure is saved as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("Nadaraya_Watson_Estimation.png") at 300 dpi.
