Name of Quantlet: GMVP_Unconstrained_vs_NoShortSell

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script defines two functions to compute Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) weights. 
The first function calculates the GMVP weights using the inverse of the covariance matrix assuming 
no constraints. The second function computes GMVP weights under the no short-selling constraint 
using quadratic programming. These tools are useful for financial analysts and quantitative researchers 
interested in optimal asset allocation.
