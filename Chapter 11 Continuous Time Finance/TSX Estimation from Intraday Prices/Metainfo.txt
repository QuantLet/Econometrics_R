Name of Quantlet: RKX_Estimator_ParzenKernel_HighFrequency

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script implements the Realized Kernel with noise adjustment (RKX) estimator using 
high-frequency financial price data. It reads price data from an Excel file, computes log returns, 
estimates noise-adjusted volatility using slow and fast subsampling frequencies, and constructs 
the RKX estimator with a Parzen kernel for autocovariance adjustment. The result is an 
annualized covariance matrix that accounts for microstructure noise.

Keywords: 
RKX, Realized Kernel, High-Frequency Data, Noise-Robust Volatility, Microstructure Noise, 
Parzen Kernel, Covariance Estimation, Log Returns, Econometrics, Financial Time Series
