Name of Quantlet: TSX_Estimator_HighFrequency_Volatility

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description:  This R script computes the Two-Scale Realized Variance (TSX) estimator from high-frequency financial data. It reads a high-frequency price dataset from an Excel file, extracts the relevant series, and applies subsampling techniques at two different frequencies (slow and fast) to estimate the integrated volatility robustly in the presence of microstructure noise. The final TSX estimator is annualized to facilitate interpretation. The script ensures the working directory is properly set, and uses the `readxl` package for data loading.

Keywords:  Two-Scale Realized Variance, TSX Estimator, High-Frequency Data, Microstructure Noise, Financial Econometrics, Covariance Estimation, Volatility Estimation, R
