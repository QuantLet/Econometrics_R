Name of Quantlet: TSX_Estimator_HighFrequency_Volatility

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script computes the Two-Scale Realized Variance (TSX) estimator from high-frequency 
financial data. It reads a high-frequency price dataset from an Excel file, extracts the 
relevant series, and applies subsampling techniques at two different frequencies (slow and fast) 
to estimate the integrated volatility robustly in the presence of microstructure noise. 
The final TSX estimator is annualized to facilitate interpretation. The script ensures 
the working directory is properly set, and uses the `readxl` package for data loading.

Keywords:
