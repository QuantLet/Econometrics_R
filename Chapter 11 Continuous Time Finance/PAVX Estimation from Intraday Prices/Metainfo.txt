Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script implements the Pre-Averaging (PAVX) estimator to compute the Two-Scale Realized 
Variance (TSRV) from high-frequency log-price data, following the methodology of Jacod et al. (2009). 
It reads intraday price data from an Excel file, computes log returns, applies pre-averaging to 
reduce the impact of microstructure noise, and annualizes the resulting variance estimate.

Keywords:
