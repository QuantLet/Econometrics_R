Name of Quantlet: SpectralAnalysis_Simulation_AirPassengers

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description:  This R script performs spectral analysis on a simulated time series composed of sine and cosine waves, and on the classic AirPassengers dataset. The simulated time series is analyzed to understand its frequency structure through a spectrum plot. Similarly, the AirPassengers data is analyzed after smoothing and detrending to identify dominant cycles. Both time series and their spectral densities are plotted and saved as PNG files. The script also identifies and reports the frequency associated with the highest spectral density in the AirPassengers data.

Keywords:  Spectral Analysis, Time Series, Frequency Domain, AirPassengers, Simulation, Spectrum, Periodicity, R
