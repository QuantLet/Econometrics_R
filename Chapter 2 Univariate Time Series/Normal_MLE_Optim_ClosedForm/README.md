Name of Quantlet: Normal_MLE_Optim_ClosedForm

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script demonstrates maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the mean and variance of a normal distribution using both numerical optimisation and closed-form formulas. It first simulates 100 observations from a N(5, 3^2) distribution. A negative log-likelihood function in terms of (mu, sigma^2) is defined, and optim() is used to obtain numerical MLEs starting from initial values (0, 1). The script then computes the closed-form MLEs: the sample mean for mu and the average squared deviation from the mean for sigma^2. Both sets of estimates are printed to the console, allowing a direct comparison between the optimisation-based solution and the analytical formulas for the normal model.

Keywords: Econometrics, Maximum Likelihood, Normal Distribution, MLE, Optimisation, optim, Closed-form Estimators, R
