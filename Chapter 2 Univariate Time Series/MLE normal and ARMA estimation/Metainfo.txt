Name of Quantlet: MLE_Normal_ARMA_Estimation

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script performs maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for two types of models. 
First, it estimates the mean and variance parameters of a normally distributed dataset 
using both direct calculation and optimization of the log-likelihood function. 
Second, it simulates an ARMA(1,1) process, defines the corresponding log-likelihood function, 
and uses numerical optimization to estimate the AR and MA parameters along with the noise variance. 
The script is structured into clear sections for simulation, likelihood definition, optimization, and output display.

Keywords: 
Maximum Likelihood Estimation, MLE, Normal Distribution, ARMA Model, AR(1), MA(1), Time Series Simulation, Log-Likelihood, Optimization, R
