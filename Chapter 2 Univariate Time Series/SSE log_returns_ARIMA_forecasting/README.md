Name of Quantlet: SSE_LogReturns_ARIMA_Forecast

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description:  This R script analyzes the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Index by first plotting the index over time, then calculating the log returns of the index. It fits an ARIMA model to the training portion of the log returns using automatic model selection via the `auto.arima` function. The script produces and saves plots of the original SSE index, the ACF and PACF of the log returns, and the forecasts along with actual test data. Forecast uncertainty is represented by an 80% confidence interval ribbon. All results are saved as PNG files in the working directory.

Keywords:  SSE Index, Log Returns, ARIMA Model, Time Series Analysis, ACF, PACF, Forecasting, Model Selection, Visualization, R
