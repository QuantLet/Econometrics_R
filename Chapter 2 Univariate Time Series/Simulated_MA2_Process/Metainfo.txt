Name of Quantlet: Simulated_MA2_Process

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script simulates and visualises a moving average process of order 2 (MA(2)). It defines a helper function simulate_ma2() that generates an MA(2) time series of length n using Gaussian innovations with standard deviation sigma and parameters theta1 and theta2. Using a fixed random seed for reproducibility, the script simulates a length-1000 MA(2) series with theta1 = 0.5, theta2 = -0.3, and sigma = 1, stores the result in a data frame with a time index, and then employs ggplot2 to produce a line plot of the simulated process over time. The resulting figure is exported as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("simulated-ma2.png").

Keywords: Econometrics, Time Series, Moving Average, MA(2), Simulation, Linear Processes, R, ggplot2
