Name of Quantlet: Simulated_ARMA11_Process

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script simulates and visualises an ARMA(1,1) time series. Using stats::arima.sim(), it generates a length-1000 ARMA(1,1) process with autoregressive parameter ar = 0.6 and moving-average parameter ma = 0.7 under Gaussian innovations, with a fixed random seed for reproducibility. The simulated series is stored in a data frame with an explicit time index, and ggplot2 is used to produce a line plot showing the ARMA(1,1) path over time. The resulting figure is saved as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("simulated-arma11.png") in the working directory.

Keywords: Econometrics, Time Series, ARMA(1,1), Simulation, Linear Processes, R, ggplot2
