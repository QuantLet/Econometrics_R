Name of Quantlet: Wold_Decomposition_AR1_MA10

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script illustrates the Wold decomposition idea by approximating a stationary AR(1) process with a finite-order MA model. It first simulates a length-1000 AR(1) time series with coefficient phi = 0.9 using Gaussian white noise innovations. It then fits an MA(10) model without a mean term using forecast::Arima(), treating the MA(10) specification as a finite Wold-style representation of the underlying AR(1) process. The script extracts the fitted values from the MA(10) model, combines the original and fitted series into a data frame, and uses ggplot2 to generate a line plot comparing the true AR(1) path against its MA(10) approximation over time. The resulting figure is saved as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("Wold-decomposition.png").
