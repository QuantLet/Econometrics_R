Name of Quantlet: Random_Walk_Single_vs_Ensemble

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script illustrates the difference between time-series (single-realization) and ensemble perspectives for a simple random walk. It first simulates one length-1000 random walk defined by Y_t = Y_{t-1} + ε_t with Gaussian increments, computes the sample mean and variance from this single path, and plots the realization over time, saving the figure as "single_realization.png". It then simulates N = 50 independent random walks of the same length, computes the ensemble average and variance of Y_t across paths at a fixed time point t = 100, and reshapes the simulated paths into long format for ggplot2. A plot of all 50 random walk trajectories is produced and saved as "50_random_walks_plot.png". Finally, the script prints the single-path estimates and the ensemble statistics to the console, highlighting the contrast between time-average and ensemble-average behaviour in random walk models.
