Name of Quantlet: MLE_Efficiency_Normal_Simulation

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script investigates the efficiency of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for 
the mean and variance parameters of a normal distribution through large-scale simulation. 
It generates 100,000 random samples from a normal distribution with specified true parameters, 
computes MLE estimates for each sample, and assesses the average behavior of the estimates. 
The script also produces and saves histograms with density overlays showing the empirical distributions 
of the MLEs for both the mean and standard deviation.

Keywords: 
Maximum Likelihood Estimation, MLE, Simulation, Normal Distribution, Efficiency, Histograms, Density Plots, R
