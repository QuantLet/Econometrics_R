Name of Quantlet: Yule_Walker_AR2_Estimation

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script illustrates estimation of AR(2) parameters via the Yule–Walker equations and compares the results with the built-in ar.yw() estimator. It first simulates a length-1000 AR(2) time series using arima.sim() with true coefficients (0.6, -0.4) under Gaussian innovations. It then computes the sample autocovariances up to lag 2 using acf() with plotting disabled, extracts the empirical γ_0, γ_1, and γ_2 values, and constructs the 2×2 Yule–Walker system based on these estimates. The script solves this linear system for the AR(2) coefficients (φ_1, φ_2) via solve() and prints the resulting estimates. In a second step, it applies ar.yw() with order.max = 2 to the same simulated series, retrieves the AR coefficients from the fitted object, and prints them, allowing a direct comparison between the manual Yule–Walker solution and the standard implementation.
