Name of Quantlet: Simulate_ARMA_AR_MA_ACF_PACF

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description:  This R script sets the working directory automatically to the location where the script is saved. It simulates various time series processes, including a manually constructed MA(2) process, an ARMA(1,1) process, and standard AR(1) and MA(1) models using the `arima.sim` function. The script generates line plots for the simulated series and computes and plots the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for the respective models. All plots are saved as PNG files in the working directory.

Keywords:  Time Series, MA(2) Process, ARMA(1,1) Process, AR(1) Model, MA(1) Model, ACF, PACF, Simulation, Visualization, R
