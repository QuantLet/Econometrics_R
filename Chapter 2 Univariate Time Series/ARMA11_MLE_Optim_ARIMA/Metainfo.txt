Name of Quantlet: ARMA11_MLE_Optim_Arima

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script illustrates maximum likelihood estimation for an ARMA(1,1) model using both a user-defined log-likelihood and the built-in arima() function. It first simulates 500 observations from an ARMA(1,1) process with true parameters ar = 0.5 and ma = 0.4 under Gaussian innovations. A custom negative log-likelihood function loglik_arma11() is then defined in terms of the AR(1) coefficient (phi), MA(1) coefficient (theta), and innovation standard deviation (sigma), with residuals computed recursively. The script uses optim() with the BFGS method and a supplied Hessian to obtain numerical MLEs and prints the estimated parameters and maximised log-likelihood value. For comparison, it also fits an ARMA(1,1) model via arima(data, order = c(1, 0, 1), method = "ML") and prints the standard output, allowing a direct comparison between the manual MLE implementation and R’s built-in maximum likelihood estimator.
