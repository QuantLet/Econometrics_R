Name of Quantlet: RF_Volatility_Forecast_SPY

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script illustrates how to forecast next-day volatility using a random forest 
model applied to daily equity index data. It downloads SPY (S&P 500 ETF) prices from 
Yahoo Finance, computes daily log returns (in percent) and a volatility proxy 
(squared returns), and defines the forecasting target as the next-day squared return. 
The feature set consists of several lags of the squared returns and of the absolute 
returns. The data are split into training and test samples; a random forest is then 
fitted with the ranger package, permutation-based variable importance scores are 
reported, and the out-of-sample RMSE of the random forest forecaster is compared to 
a simple naive mean benchmark.
