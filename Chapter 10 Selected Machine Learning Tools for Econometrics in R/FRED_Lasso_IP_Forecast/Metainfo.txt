Name of Quantlet: FRED_Lasso_IP_Forecast

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script demonstrates how to forecast U.S. industrial production growth using 
high-dimensional lagged macroeconomic predictors and regularized regression. It downloads monthly time series from the FRED API (industrial production, unemployment rate, CPI, and the federal funds rate), constructs transformed series (industrial production growth, inflation, and first differences of unemployment and the policy rate), and builds a feature set comprising 12 lags of each variable. The data are split into a training and a test sample. A lasso regression is then fitted with 10-fold cross-validation via glmnet, the selected coefficients and test RMSE are reported, and the performance is compared to a naive mean forecast and to a ridge regression benchmark. A brief illustration of time-series-aware cross-validation using a blocked fold structure is also included.
