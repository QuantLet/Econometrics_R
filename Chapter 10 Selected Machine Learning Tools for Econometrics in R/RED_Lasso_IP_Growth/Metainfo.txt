Name of Quantlet: SPY_Lasso_RF_VolForecast

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: Downloads daily SPY prices from Yahoo Finance, computes log returns and squared returns as a proxy for realised volatility, and constructs a high-dimensional predictor set using lags of squared and absolute returns plus day-of-week dummies. The script uses a blocked time-series cross-validation scheme on the initial subsample to select the lasso penalty in a glmnet regression, specifies a GARCH(1,1) benchmark via rugarch, and then runs a rolling-window forecasting exercise. For each forecast origin it re-estimates an AR(1) on squared returns, a GARCH(1,1) on returns, a lasso regression, and a random forest model, produces one-step-ahead volatility forecasts, and compares their out-of-sample RMSEs. An optional ggplot2 figure illustrates realised volatility versus the lasso forecast over the evaluation period.

Keywords: SPY, volatility, squared returns, GARCH, lasso, random forest, glmnet, rugarch, ranger, time-series cross-validation, machine learning, forecasting, R
