Name of Quantlet: SPY_Unit_Root_Tests_Full_vs_Recent

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script performs and compares unit root and stationarity tests on SPY log prices and log returns over a long historical sample and a more recent subsample. It downloads daily SPY prices from Yahoo Finance via quantmod::getSymbols() starting in 2000, constructs a data frame with dates, adjusted closing prices, log prices, and log returns, and then partitions the data into a full sample and a recent sample beginning in 2024. A helper function run_unit_root_tests() is defined to run Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) tests using urca::ur.df() and KPSS tests using urca::ur.kpss(), printing concise summaries of test statistics and critical values.

For log prices (typically close to I(1)), the script applies an ADF test with drift and both level- and trend-stationary KPSS tests for the full sample and the recent sample. For log returns (usually closer to I(0)), it performs ADF tests without drift and KPSS tests for level stationarity only. The output provides a side-by-side comparison of test results across series (log price vs log return) and sample periods (full vs recent), helping illustrate the empirical behaviour of unit root and stationarity diagnostics in financial time series.
