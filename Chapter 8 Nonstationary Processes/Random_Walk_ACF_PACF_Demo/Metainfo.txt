Name of Quantlet: Random_Walk_ACF_PACF_Demo

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script simulates a univariate random walk and visualises its time-series behaviour as well as its autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions. It generates 500 observations from the model Y_t = Y_{t−1} + ε_t with Gaussian white-noise innovations, starting from zero. Using ggplot2, the script produces a time-series plot of the simulated random walk, and with forecast::ggAcf() and forecast::ggPacf() it constructs ACF and PACF plots. The ACF and PACF are combined into a single panel via patchwork and displayed in the R plotting window. Together, these plots highlight the slow decay of the autocorrelations and the nonstationary nature of the random walk.
