Name of Quantlet: AR1_Simulation_ACF_PACF_Plots

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script simulates an AR(1) time series and visualises its time-domain behaviour along with its autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions. It generates 500 observations from the process Y_t = 0.9 Y_{t−1} + ε_t with Gaussian white-noise innovations, starting from zero. A time-series plot of Y_t against t is created using ggplot2 and saved as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("AR1_plot.png"). The script then uses forecast::ggAcf() and forecast::ggPacf() to produce ggplot-based ACF and PACF plots for the simulated series, each annotated with the model expression in the title. These two graphics are combined side-by-side via patchwork and saved as a 12 x 4 inch PNG file ("AR1_acf_pacf_plot.png"), providing a concise illustration of the characteristic geometric decay of the ACF and single significant spike in the PACF for an AR(1) process.
