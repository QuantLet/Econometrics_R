Name of Quantlet: AR1_RandomWalk_Shock_Comparison

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script compares the impact of a one-time negative shock on a stationary AR(1) process and on a random walk. It simulates two AR(1) series with coefficient φ = 0.8 over 250 observations using the same innovation sequence: one baseline series without shocks and one where a negative shock of size −5 is added to the innovation at a chosen time point (t = 100). The resulting paths are assembled into a data frame and plotted with ggplot2, showing the “With Shock” and “Without Shock” series together; the figure is saved as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("ar1_comparison_plot.png"). The script then repeats the exercise for a random walk X_t = X_{t−1} + ε_t, again with and without a one-time negative shock, using a common innovation sequence. A second ggplot compares the shocked and unshocked random walk paths, saved as "rw_comparison_plot.png". Together, these plots visually illustrate how shocks to stationary and non-stationary processes differ in persistence: mean-reverting in the AR(1) case versus permanent level shifts in the random walk case.
