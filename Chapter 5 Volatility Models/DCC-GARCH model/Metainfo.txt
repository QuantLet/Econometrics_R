Name of Quantlet: DCCGARCH_DowJones_TSX_DynamicCorrelation

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script simulates the return series of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P/TSX 
Composite Index, removes serial correlation by fitting univariate ARIMA models, and applies a 
DCC-GARCH(1,1) model to the residuals. It estimates and extracts the dynamic conditional correlations 
between the two financial indices. The script visualizes the evolution of the off-diagonal dynamic 
correlation over time and saves the output plot as a PNG file.

Keywords: 
DCC-GARCH, Dynamic Correlation, Multivariate GARCH, Time Series Analysis, Financial Econometrics, 
Dow Jones, S&P/TSX, ARIMA Residuals, Conditional Correlation, Volatility Modeling, R
