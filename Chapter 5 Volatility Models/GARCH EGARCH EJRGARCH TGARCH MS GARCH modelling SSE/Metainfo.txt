Description: 
This R script analyzes the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Index by first computing log returns 
and fitting various volatility models, including GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH(1,1), and 
Threshold GARCH (TGARCH) models. It also fits a Markov Switching GARCH (MS-GARCH) model with 
two regimes using the MSwM package. Model specifications, estimation results, and comparisons 
are provided, helping to understand different dynamics in volatility clustering and regime-switching 
behavior in financial time series.

Keywords:
