Published in: Econometrics_R

Description:  This R script analyzes the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Index by first computing log returns and fitting various volatility models, including GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH(1,1), and Threshold GARCH (TGARCH) models. It also fits a Markov Switching GARCH (MS-GARCH) model with two regimes using the MSwM package. Model specifications, estimation results, and comparisons are provided, helping to understand different dynamics in volatility clustering and regime-switching behavior in financial time series.

Keywords:  GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, TGARCH, MS-GARCH, Markov Switching, Volatility Modeling, SSE Index, Financial Time Series, R
