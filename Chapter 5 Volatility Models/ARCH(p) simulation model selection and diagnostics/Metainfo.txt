Name of Quantlet: ARCHp_Simulation_ModelSelection_Diagnostics

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script simulates an ARCH(p) process, fits ARCH models of different orders, and selects 
the best model using AIC and BIC criteria. After identifying the optimal lag order, the script 
fits the final ARCH model, displays the model summary, and conducts diagnostic checking using 
the Ljung-Box test on standardized residuals. The simulated ARCH(p) series is visualized and 
saved as a PNG file in the working directory.

Keywords: 
ARCH Model, ARCH(p), Simulation, Volatility Clustering, Model Selection, AIC, BIC, Residual Diagnostics, Ljung-Box Test, Time Series, R
