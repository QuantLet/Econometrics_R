Name of Quantlet: IGARCH11_Model_Specification_Estimation

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script specifies and fits an Integrated GARCH (IGARCH)(1,1) model to a given time series 
dataset. The variance dynamics follow an IGARCH process where the conditional variance depends 
on both past squared returns and past variances without a stationarity constraint. 
The model assumes normally distributed innovations. The script uses the rugarch package for 
model specification and fitting and outputs the model estimation results.

Keywords:
