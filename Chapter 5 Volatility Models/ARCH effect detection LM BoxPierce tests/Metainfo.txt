Name of Quantlet: ARCH_Effect_Tests_LM_McLeodLi

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script simulates an AR(1) process, fits a conditional mean model, extracts residuals, 
and performs two popular tests to detect ARCH effects: (1) the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test 
based on an auxiliary regression of squared residuals, and (2) the Box-Pierce-type Portmanteau 
test (McLeod-Li test) based on autocorrelations of squared residuals. The script outputs both 
test statistics for assessing the presence of volatility clustering in time series data.
