Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
Downloads high-frequency (1-minute) intraday stock prices from the 
Alpha Vantage API, computes realized volatility at different sampling 
frequencies (1-minute vs aggregated k-minute bars), and visualizes the

market microstructure noise and volatility clustering.
