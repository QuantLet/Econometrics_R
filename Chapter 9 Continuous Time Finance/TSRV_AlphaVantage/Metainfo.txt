Name of Quantlet: TSRV_AlphaVantage

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script downloads intraday high-frequency stock prices from the Alpha Vantage API using quantmod, and computes the Two-Scale Realized Volatility (TSRV) estimator to adjust for market microstructure noise. After fetching 1-minute intraday prices for a chosen symbol (e.g. AAPL), the script constructs a log-price series, splits it into K subsamples, computes subsample realized volatilities, and combines them with the full-sample realized volatility to obtain the TSRV estimate.

Keywords: high-frequency data, realized volatility, TSRV, Two-Scale Realized Volatility, microstructure noise, Alpha Vantage, quantmod, xts, R
