Name of Quantlet: Subsampling_BlockBootstrap_SP500

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script implements subsampling and block bootstrap procedures to assess the sampling distributions 
of the sample mean and the first-order autocorrelation of squared returns for the S&P500 index from 
January 2000 to December 2024. The subsampling approach uses 5-year rolling windows to construct 
empirical distributions of test statistics. The block bootstrap uses overlapping blocks to simulate 
replicates and estimate the finite-sample distribution of the sample mean. The script visualizes the 
empirical distributions and overlays theoretical approximations for inference.
