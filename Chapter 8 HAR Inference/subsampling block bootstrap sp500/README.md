Name of Quantlet: Subsampling_BlockBootstrap_SP500

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description:  This R script implements subsampling and block bootstrap procedures to assess the sampling distributions of the sample mean and the first-order autocorrelation of squared returns for the S&P500 index from January 2000 to December 2024. The subsampling approach uses 5-year rolling windows to construct empirical distributions of test statistics. The block bootstrap uses overlapping blocks to simulate replicates and estimate the finite-sample distribution of the sample mean. The script visualizes the empirical distributions and overlays theoretical approximations for inference.

Keywords:  Subsampling, Block Bootstrap, S&P500, Time Series, Rolling Window, Mean Return, Autocorrelation, Bootstrap Inference, Financial Data, R
