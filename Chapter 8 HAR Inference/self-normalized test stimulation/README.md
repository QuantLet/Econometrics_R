Name of Quantlet: SelfNormalized_M_S_Test_Simulation

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 

This R script simulates the finite-sample distributions of two self-normalized test statistics:  Hong et al.'s (2024) M-test and Shao's (2010) S-test. The script compares them to the standard normal distribution. Simulated results are saved as CSV files, critical values are computed and exported to a LaTeX table, and kernel density plots of the empirical distributions are generated and saved as a PNG file. The simulation is based on large-sample Brownian motion approximations to evaluate the behavior of these test statistics under the null hypothesis.

Keywords:  Self-Normalization, M-test, S-test, Hong et al. (2024), Shao (2010), Simulation, Brownian Bridge, Time Series, Critical Values, R
