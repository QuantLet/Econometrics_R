Published in: Econometrics_R

Description:  This R script estimates the Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (C-CAPM) using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). It downloads macroeconomic time series from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and financial market data from Yahoo Finance. The model constructs moment conditions based on the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution, then estimates the risk aversion and discount factor parameters. The script also conducts an overidentifying restrictions test (Hansen J-test) to assess model validity.

Keywords:  C-CAPM, GMM, Consumption Growth, Excess Returns, FRED, Yahoo Finance, Hansen J-test, Asset Pricing, R
