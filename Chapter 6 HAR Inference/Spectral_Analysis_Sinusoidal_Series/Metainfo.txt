Name of Quantlet: Spectral_Analysis_Sinusoidal_Series

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script illustrates basic spectral analysis on a synthetic time series composed of two sinusoidal components. It simulates a series x(t) as the sum of a 10-period cosine and a 5-period sine over t ∈ [0, 100] with step size 0.1, and stores the result in a data frame. The script then computes the (raw) periodogram using the base R spectrum() function with plotting suppressed, extracting the frequency grid and corresponding spectral density values. Two ggplot2 graphics are constructed: (i) a time-domain plot of the simulated series x(t), and (ii) a frequency-domain plot of the estimated spectrum versus frequency. These two panels are combined vertically using ggpubr::ggarrange() and saved as a single 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("spectral.png") at 300 dpi, providing a clear visual link between the time-series representation and its spectral decomposition.
