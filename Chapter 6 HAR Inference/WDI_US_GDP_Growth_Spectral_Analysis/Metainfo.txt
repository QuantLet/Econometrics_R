Name of Quantlet: WDI_US_GDP_Growth_Spectral_Analysis

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script retrieves and analyses US real GDP growth (annual %) from the World Bank’s WDI database, combining time-domain and frequency-domain perspectives. Using WDI::WDI(), it downloads the indicator NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG for the United States from 1960 onward, sorts the series by year, and removes missing observations. The annual growth rates are stored as a univariate time-series object with frequency 1. A line-and-point time plot of the annual growth rates is then constructed using ggplot2 and saved as a 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("wdi_annual_gdp_growth_timeseries.png"). For spectral analysis, the script applies the base R spectrum() function to the annual time series with a (3,3)-span smoothing and detrending, requesting the output without plotting. The resulting frequency and spectral density arrays are placed into a data frame and visualised with ggplot2 as a smoothed spectral density plot titled "Smoothed spectral density of US annual GDP growth", which is saved as another 6 x 4 inch PNG file ("wdi_annual_gdp_growth_spectrum.png"). This provides an example of how to investigate cyclical components in macroeconomic growth data via spectral methods.
