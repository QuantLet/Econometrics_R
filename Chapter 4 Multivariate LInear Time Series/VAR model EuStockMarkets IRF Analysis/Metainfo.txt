Name of Quantlet: VAR_LogReturns_EuStockMarkets_IRF

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script fits a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to the logarithmic returns of the 
EuStockMarkets dataset. It selects the optimal lag length using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), 
estimates the VAR model, and generates impulse response functions (IRFs) for all pairs of variables. 
Each IRF plot is saved as a PNG file in the working directory. 
The script uses tidyverse for data manipulation and the vars package for VAR modeling.

Keywords:
