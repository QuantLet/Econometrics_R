Name of Quantlet: Spurious_Regression_RandomWalks

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script demonstrates the concept of spurious regression by simulating two independent 
random walk processes and regressing one on the other. Although the two series are unrelated, 
the regression may show a statistically significant relationship due to their nonstationary nature. 
The script fits a linear model, outputs the regression summary, and generates a scatter plot with the 
fitted regression line. The plot is displayed and saved as a PNG file in the working directory.

Keywords: 
Spurious Regression, Random Walk, Time Series Simulation, Nonstationarity, Linear Model, Visualization, R
