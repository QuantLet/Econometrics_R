Name of Quantlet: Cointegration_DAX_SMI_EuStockMarkets

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script investigates the cointegration relationship between the DAX and SMI indices from the 
EuStockMarkets dataset. It performs linear regressions between the indices, plots the residuals, 
and applies the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test to the regression residuals. 
Additionally, it conducts the Johansen cointegration tests (both Eigenvalue and Trace tests) 
to formally assess the number of cointegration relationships. Scatter plots and residual plots 
are generated and saved as PNG files in the working directory.
