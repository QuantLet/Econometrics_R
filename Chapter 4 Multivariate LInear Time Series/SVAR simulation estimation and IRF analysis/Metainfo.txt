Name of Quantlet: SVAR_Simulation_A_B_Model_IRF

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: 
This R script simulates multivariate time series data from a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) process, 
estimates the reduced-form VAR(1) model, and then identifies the structural shocks using both A-model 
and B-model restrictions. It calculates and plots the Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) for each model. 
The simulated time series, as well as the IRFs for the A-model and B-model, are plotted and saved 
as PNG files in the working directory.

Keywords: 
Structural VAR, SVAR, Time Series Simulation, VAR Estimation, Impulse Response Function, A-Model, B-Model, R
