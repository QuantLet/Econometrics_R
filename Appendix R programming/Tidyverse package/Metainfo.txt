Name of Quantlet: Tidyverse_Data_Manipulation_Visualisation

Published in: Econometrics_R

Description: This R script demonstrates core tidyverse workflows for data manipulation, graphics, and basic API-based data access. Using the nycflights13::flights dataset, it applies key dplyr verbs—filter(), select(), arrange(), mutate(), group_by(), and summarise()—to subset, transform, and aggregate flight data (for example, computing average delays by carrier and origin and constructing a simple speed variable). It then uses ggplot2 with the mpg dataset to build a sequence of plots illustrating the layers of the Grammar of Graphics: data and aesthetic layers, geometric layers (scatterplots and histograms), additional aesthetics (colour, size, shape), faceting by drive type and vehicle class, statistical smoothing layers, coordinate and scale control (including coord_equal() and coord_cartesian()), and saving plots to PNG files via ggsave(). Finally, the script illustrates API-based data retrieval via the WDI package by downloading World Bank GDP-per-capita and population series for selected countries and plotting GDP per capita over time.
